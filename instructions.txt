Prereq : 

 Install npm (latest) , truffle and geth

Main Instruction :

- Delete existing n1/2/3
- Run init.sh
- Note down addresses in Address.txt and make relevant changes in genesis.json
- Run start.sh
- Run startn1/2/3.sh
- Open separate terminals and use command : geth attach http://127.0.0.1:8001 (same for 8002/3)
- Connect Peers together ( Run admin.nodeInfo at each startn* consoles , note down enode value and then in other console of startn* use admin.addPeers('<enode-value>') )
- Set Etherbase for miners (miner.setEthBase(eth.accounts[1]) in n1 and n3)
- Unlock accounts in each node (personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[0]) in n* and add [1] in n1 & n3)
- Start Miners (miner.start() in startn* consoles for n1 and n3)
- Start Remix (http://remix.ethereum.org/)
- Create your desired smart contract
- Go to plugin manager and add Solidity Compiler, Deploy and Run Transaction Options
- Solidity Compiler will keep on compiling your contracts automatically and then show errors if any
- In Deploy and Run Option, choose environment as "Web Provider" and then provide http://localhost:8001 or your own RPC point  as endpoint   
- Set amount in value part while sending transactions
- If a contract is deployed by node 1 and you want to use contract interface at node 2, then note down contract address when its deployed and use "At address" option at Remix to interact with 
 contract.
